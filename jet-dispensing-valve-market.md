<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jet Dispensing Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Jet Valves</li><li>Non-contact Jet Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Jet dispensing valves are classified into two main types: contact jet valves and non-contact jet valves. Contact jet valves utilize physical contact between the dispensing tip and the substrate to control the flow of material, ensuring precise dispensing. On the other hand, non-contact jet valves use pneumatic or electromagnetic forces to dispense material without touching the substrate, allowing for high-speed and non-contact dispensing. Both types offer unique benefits and are suitable for different applications in industries such as electronics, automotive, and medical devices.</p></p>
