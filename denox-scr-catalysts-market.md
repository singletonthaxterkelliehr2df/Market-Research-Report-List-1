<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DeNOx-SCR Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Honeycomb</li><li>Plate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DeNOx-SCR catalysts are commonly divided into two types based on their structure: honeycomb and plate catalysts. Honeycomb catalysts have a honeycomb-like structure with channels for the exhaust gas flow, allowing for a high surface area and efficient contact between the gases and the catalyst material. Plate catalysts, on the other hand, have a flat plate structure with a higher mechanical resistance, making them suitable for harsh operating conditions. Both types of catalysts are used in the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from various industrial processes.</p></p>
