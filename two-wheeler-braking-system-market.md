<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-wheeler Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ABS Braking System</li><li>CBS Braking System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Two-wheeler Braking System market primarily consists of two types â€“ ABS Braking System and CBS Braking System. ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) helps prevent wheel lock-up during sudden braking, allowing the rider to maintain control and stability. CBS (Combined Braking System) distributes braking force between the front and rear wheels simultaneously, reducing stopping distance and improving safety. Both systems are crucial in enhancing overall braking performance and rider safety in two-wheelers.</p></p>
