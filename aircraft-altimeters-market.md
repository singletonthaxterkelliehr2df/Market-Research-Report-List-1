<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Altimeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Type</li><li>Digital Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft altimeters are essential instruments that measure the altitude of an aircraft above a certain reference point. There are two main types of altimeters: analog type and digital type. Analog altimeters display altitude using a traditional needle and dial system, while digital altimeters provide altitude readings in a numerical format on a screen. Both types serve the same purpose of helping pilots navigate safely through the air, but they differ in their display methods and technology.</p></p>
