<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axial Bone Densitometry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)</li><li>Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial Bone Densitometry market includes two main types of technologies - Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). DEXA is a widely used method that measures bone mineral density and is considered the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis. QCT, on the other hand, provides a more detailed analysis of bone density and strength by using computed tomography technology. Both technologies play a crucial role in assessing bone health and risk of fractures in patients.</p></p>
