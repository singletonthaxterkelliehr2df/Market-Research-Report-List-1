<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Dehumidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Dehumidifier</li><li>Electronic Dehumidifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Residential dehumidifiers are classified into two types: Mechanical dehumidifiers and Electronic dehumidifiers. Mechanical dehumidifiers operate by drawing in air and passing it over a cooled coil to condense moisture, which is then collected in a reservoir. On the other hand, Electronic dehumidifiers use a fan to draw in air and pass it over a refrigerated coil to remove moisture, which is then collected in a reservoir. Both types are effective in reducing humidity levels in homes and improving indoor air quality.</p></p>
