<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric Vehicle Airbag Inflator market consists of three main types: Pyrotechnic Inflator, Stored Gas Inflator, and Hybrid Inflator. Pyrotechnic inflators use a small amount of explosive to rapidly inflate the airbag during a collision. Stored gas inflators rely on a compressed gas stored within the inflator to inflate the airbag. Hybrid inflators combine elements of both pyrotechnic and stored gas inflators for a more controlled and efficient inflation process. Each type of inflator offers unique benefits and features for electric vehicle safety systems.</p></p>
