<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylate Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylate adhesives are commonly categorized into two main types based on their curing mechanism: thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic acrylate adhesives are characterized by their ability to soften when heated and solidify when cooled, allowing for repositioning before curing. On the other hand, thermosetting acrylate adhesives undergo a chemical reaction during curing that permanently hardens the adhesive, providing a strong and durable bond. Both types offer unique advantages and are commonly used in various industries for bonding different materials.</p></p>
