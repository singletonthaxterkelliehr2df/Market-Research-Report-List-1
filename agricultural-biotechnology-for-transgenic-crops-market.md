<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Biotechnology for Transgenic Crops Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Artificial Genetically Modified(GM)</li><li>Natural Genetically Modified(GM)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural biotechnology involves the use of genetic modification to enhance crop production. Transgenic crops can be classified into two market types: Artificial Genetically Modified (GM) and Natural Genetically Modified (GM). Artificial GM crops are created in a lab by inserting genes from one species into another to achieve desired traits, such as pest resistance or increased yield. Natural GM crops, on the other hand, occur through natural processes such as hybridization or gene transfer between species in the wild. Both types of transgenic crops play a significant role in modern agriculture.</p></p>
