<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temperature Controlled Packaging for Pharmaceuticals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Temperature Controlled System</li><li>Passive Temperature Controlled System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active Temperature Controlled Systems are packaging solutions that require an external power source to regulate the temperature inside the package. This type of system typically uses electrical components such as heating/cooling elements and sensors to actively monitor and control the temperature. On the other hand, Passive Temperature Controlled Systems do not require an external power source and rely on insulating materials such as foam or phase change materials to maintain the desired temperature. Passive systems are often more cost-effective but may have limitations in extreme temperature conditions.</p></p>
