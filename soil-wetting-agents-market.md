<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Wetting Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyacrylic Acid Salt</li><li>Polyacrylamide</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soil wetting agents are products used to improve the penetration and distribution of water in soil. Two common types of wetting agents are Polyacrylic Acid Salt and Polyacrylamide. Polyacrylic Acid Salt is a type of wetting agent that works by reducing the surface tension of water, allowing it to spread more easily throughout the soil. Polyacrylamide, on the other hand, is a type of wetting agent that helps to retain moisture in the soil by increasing its water holding capacity. Both types of wetting agents are used to improve soil moisture levels and promote better plant growth.</p></p>
