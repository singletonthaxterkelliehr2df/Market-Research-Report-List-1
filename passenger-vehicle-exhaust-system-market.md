<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Exhaust System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Exhaust System</li><li>Dual Exhaust System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A single exhaust system refers to a vehicle exhaust system that uses only one set of pipes and mufflers to expel exhaust gases from the engine. These systems are commonly found in smaller vehicles and are more cost-effective. On the other hand, a dual exhaust system utilizes two sets of pipes and mufflers, allowing for better engine performance and greater exhaust flow. Dual exhaust systems are typically found in larger vehicles or high-performance cars, providing improved sound and overall efficiency.</p></p>
