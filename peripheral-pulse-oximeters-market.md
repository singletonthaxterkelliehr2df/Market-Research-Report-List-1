<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Pulse Oximeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable Sensor</li><li>Reusable Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peripheral pulse oximeters are medical devices used to measure the oxygen saturation level and pulse rate in a patient's blood. The market for these devices includes two major types of sensors - disposable and reusable. Disposable sensors are single-use sensors that are discarded after each patient use, while reusable sensors can be cleaned and sterilized for multiple uses. Both types serve the same purpose of measuring oxygen saturation and pulse rate, but differ in terms of cost-effectiveness and convenience for healthcare providers.</p></p>
