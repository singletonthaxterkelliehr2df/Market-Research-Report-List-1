<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aerostatic</li><li>Aerodynamic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas bearings are classified into two main types based on their operation: Aerostatic and Aerodynamic. </p><p>Aerostatic gas bearings rely on the pressure of a gas film to support the rotating shaft, creating a gap between the shaft and bearing surface. This type of bearing provides high load capacity, stiffness, and damping capabilities.</p><p>Aerodynamic gas bearings, on the other hand, use the gas flow generated by the rotation of the shaft to create a thin film of gas between the shaft and bearing surface, reducing friction and wear. These bearings are suitable for high-speed applications and offer low power consumption.</p></p>
