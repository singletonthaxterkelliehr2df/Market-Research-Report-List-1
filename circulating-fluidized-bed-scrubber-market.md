<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Circulating Fluidized Bed Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry</li><li>Semi-dry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Circulating Fluidized Bed Scrubbers are used for removing pollutants from industrial exhaust gases. The dry scrubber type uses a dry sorbent to neutralize pollutants, while the semi-dry scrubber type uses a wet sorbent mixed with water. Dry scrubbers are more cost-effective and simpler to operate, but may require additional equipment for handling and disposal of the sorbent. Semi-dry scrubbers offer higher pollutant removal efficiency but require a larger footprint and have higher operating costs due to water consumption and wastewater treatment.</p></p>
