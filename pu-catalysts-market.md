<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PU Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reactive Amine Catalysts</li><li>Non-reactive Amine Catalysts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PU Catalysts are essential components in the production of polyurethane products. Reactive Amine Catalysts are chemical compounds that actively participate in the polymerization process, accelerating the reaction rate and improving the overall efficiency of the reaction. Non-reactive Amine Catalysts, on the other hand, do not actively participate in the reaction but instead act as additives to control the reaction rate or enhance specific properties of the final product. Both types of catalysts play crucial roles in the production of polyurethane materials.</p></p>
