<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The User Virtualization Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-persistent VDI</li><li>Persistent VDI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>User virtualization software refers to technologies that manage and streamline user profiles and settings in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment. Non-persistent VDI, also known as stateless VDI, provides users with a pristine virtual desktop each time they log in, eliminating the risk of malware or system issues carrying over between sessions. Persistent VDI, on the other hand, saves user preferences and settings, allowing users to retain their personalized virtual desktop experience across multiple sessions. These software solutions enhance VDI deployments by improving user experience, security, and management capabilities.</p></p>
