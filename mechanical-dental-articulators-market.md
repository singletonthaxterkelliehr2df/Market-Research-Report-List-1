<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Dental Articulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-adjustable Dental Articulator</li><li>Fully-adjustable Dental Articulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical dental articulators are used in dentistry to simulate the movements of the temporomandibular joint. There are two main types of dental articulators - semi-adjustable and fully-adjustable. </p><p>Semi-adjustable dental articulators have limited movement capabilities and are often used for simple dental procedures. Fully-adjustable dental articulators, on the other hand, allow for precise adjustments to replicate the unique movements of an individual's jaw. They are commonly used for more complex dental treatments and procedures. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring accurate dental restorations and treatments.</p></p>
