<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bridge Rectifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-Bridge Rectifier</li><li>Half-Bridge Rectifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bridge rectifiers are electronic devices used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) by rectifying the input signal. Two common types of bridge rectifiers are full-bridge rectifiers and half-bridge rectifiers. Full-bridge rectifiers consist of four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration, allowing for better efficiency and higher output voltage. On the other hand, half-bridge rectifiers only use two diodes, making them simpler and cheaper but with lower efficiency. Both types are widely used in power supplies, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics.</p></p>
